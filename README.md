## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and materials:

- Soldering iron and solder
- Spot welder (for nickel strip welding)
- Multimeter
- Insulation materials (e.g., Kapton tape)
- Heat gun (for heat shrink)

### Assembly Instructions

1. **Design Your Battery Pack**:
   - Determine the voltage and capacity required for your application.
   - Choose the appropriate cell configuration (series and parallel).

2. **Prepare the Cells**:
   - Inspect and test each cell for capacity and voltage.
   - Arrange the cells in the desired configuration.

3. **Connect the Cells**:
   - Use nickel strips and a spot welder to connect cells in series and parallel.
   - Ensure strong, clean welds for reliable connections.

4. **Install the BMS**:
   - Connect the BMS according to the manufacturer's instructions.
   - Solder the BMS leads to the appropriate points on the battery pack.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Secure the battery pack with holders or heat shrink.
   - Add any necessary insulation and protection materials.

### Configuration

- Follow the BMS manual to configure settings such as overcharge/overdischarge protection, balancing, and temperature thresholds.
- Use provided software tools or hardware interfaces to program the BMS if required.

## Usage

- **Charging**: Use a charger compatible with your battery pack's voltage and current ratings. Ensure the charger is designed for lithium-ion batteries.
- **Discharging**: Connect your battery pack to your device or application, ensuring the current draw does not exceed the BMS limits.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check the health of your battery pack using a multimeter or BMS monitoring tools.

## Safety Considerations

- Always follow safety guidelines when handling lithium-ion cells.
- Avoid short circuits, overcharging, and deep discharging.
- Do not expose the battery pack to extreme temperatures or moisture.
- Use appropriate protective equipment when assembling and testing the battery pack.
